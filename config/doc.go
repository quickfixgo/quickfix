	time in the format of HH:MM:SS, time is represented in time zone configured by TimeZone

# EndTime

Time of day that this FIX session becomes deactivated. Valid Values:

# ResendRequestChunkSize

Setting to limit the size of a resend request in case of missing messages. This is useful when the remote FIX engine does not allow to ask for more than n message for a ResendRequest.  E.g. if the ResendRequestChunkSize is set to 5 and a gap of 7 messages is detected, a first resend request will be sent for 5 messages. When this gap has been filled, another resend request for 2 messages will be sent. If the ResendRequestChunkSize is set to 0, only one ResendRequest for all the missing messages will be sent. Value must be positive integer. Defaults to 0 (disables splitting).

	SECONDS
	MILLIS
	MICROS
	NANOS

Defaults to MILLIS.

# Validation

The following settings are specific to message validation.

# DataDictionary

XML definition file for validating incoming FIX messages. If no DataDictionary is supplied, only basic message validation will be done.

This setting should only be used with FIX transport versions older than FIXT.1.1. See TransportDataDictionary and AppDataDictionary for FIXT.1.1 settings. Value must be a valid XML data dictionary file. QuickFIX/Go comes with the following defaults in the spec directory

	FIX44.xml
	FIX43.xml
	FIX42.xml
	FIX41.xml
	FIX40.xml

# TransportDataDictionary

XML definition file for validating admin (transport) messages. This setting is only valid for FIXT.1.1 (or newer) sessions.  See DataDictionary for older transport versions (FIX.4.0 - FIX.4.4) for additional information. Value must be a valid XML data dictionary file, QuickFIX/Go comes with the following defaults in the spec directory

	FIXT1.1.xml

# AppDataDictionary

XML definition file for validating application messages. This setting is only valid for FIXT.1.1 (or newer) sessions. See DataDictionary for older transport versions (FIX.4.0 - FIX.4.4) for additional information.

This setting supports the possibility of a custom application data dictionary for each session. This setting would only be used with FIXT 1.1 and new transport protocols. This setting can be used as a prefix to specify multiple application dictionaries for the FIXT transport. For example:

	DefaultApplVerID=FIX.4.2
	# For default application version ID
	AppDataDictionary=FIX42.xml
	# For nondefault application version ID
	# Use BeginString suffix for app version
	AppDataDictionary.FIX.4.4=FIX44.xml

Value must be a valid XML data dictionary file. QuickFIX/Go comes with the following defaults in the spec directory

	FIX50SP2.xml
	FIX50SP1.xml
	FIX50.xml
	FIX44.xml
	FIX43.xml
	FIX42.xml
	FIX41.xml
	FIX40.xml

# ValidateFieldsOutOfOrder

Defaults to Y.

# RejectInvalidMessage

If RejectInvalidMessage is set to N, zero errors will be thrown on reception of message that fails data dictionary validation. Valid Values:

	Y
	N

Defaults to Y.

# CheckLatency

If set to Y, messages must be received from the counterparty within a defined number of seconds. It is useful to turn this off if a system uses localtime for it's timestamps instead of GMT. Valid Values:

	Y
	N

Defaults to Y.

# MaxLatency

If CheckLatency is set to Y, this defines the number of seconds latency allowed for a message to be processed. Value must be positive integer.

Defaults to 120.

# ReconnectInterval

Time between reconnection attempts in seconds. Only used for initiators.    Value must be positive integer.

# Defaults to 30

# Defaults to 2

# LogonTimeout

Session setting for logon timeout in seconds. Only used for initiators. Value must be positive integer.

# Defaults to 10

# HeartBtInt

If set to Y, will use the HeartBtInt interval rather than what the initiator dictates. Only used for acceptors. Valid Values:

	Y
	N

Defaults to N.

# SocketConnectPort

Socket port for connecting to a session. Only used for initiators. Must be positive integer

# SocketConnectHost

Host to connect to. Only used for initiators. Value must be a valid IPv4 or IPv6 address or a domain name

SocketConnectPort<n>

SocketConnectHost<n>

Alternate socket hosts for connecting to a session for failover, where n is a positive integer. (i.e.) SocketConnectHost1, SocketConnectHost2... must be consecutive and have a matching SocketConnectPort[n]. Value must be a valid IPv4 or IPv6 address or a domain name

# SocketTimeout

Duration of timeout for TLS handshake. Only used for initiators.

Example Values:

	SocketTimeout=30s # 30 seconds
	SocketTimeout=60m # 60 minutes

Defaults to 0(means nothing timeout).

# SocketAcceptHost

Socket host address for listening on incoming connections, only used for acceptors. By default acceptors listen on all available interfaces.

# SocketAcceptPort

Socket port for listening to incoming connections, only used for acceptors. Value must be a positive integer, valid open socket port.

Private key to use for secure TLS connections.  Must be used with SocketCertificateFile.

# SocketCertificateFile

Certificate to use for secure TLS connections. Must be used with SocketPrivateKeyFile.

# SocketCAFile

Optional root CA to use for secure TLS connections. For acceptors, client certificates will be verified against this CA.  For initiators, clients will use the CA to verify the server certificate. If not configurated, initiators will verify the server certificate using the host's root CA set.

# SocketServerName

The expected server name on a returned certificate, unless SocketInsecureSkipVerify is true. This is for the TLS Server Name Indication extension. Initiator only.

# SocketMinimumTLSVersion

Specify the Minimum TLS version to use when creating a secure connection. The valid choices are SSL30, TLS10, TLS11, TLS12. Defaults to TLS12.

# SocketUseSSL

Use SSL for initiators even if client certificates are not present. If set to N or omitted, TLS will not be used if SocketPrivateKeyFile or SocketCertificateFile are not supplied.

# ProxyType

Proxy type. Valid Values:

	socks

# ProxyHost

# Proxy server IP address in the format of x.x.x.x or a domain name

# ProxyPort

# Proxy server port

# ProxyUser

# Proxy user

	Y
	N

# PersistMessages

If set to N, no messages will be persisted. This will force QuickFIX/Go to always send GapFills instead of resending messages. Use this if you know you never want to resend a message. Useful for market data streams.  Valid Values:

	Y
	N

Defaults to Y.

# FileLogPath

Directory to store logs.	Value must be valid directory for storing files, application must have write access.

# FileStorePath

Directory to store sequence number and message files.  Only used with FileStoreFactory.

# SQLStoreDataSourceName

The driver-specific data source name of the database to use.  Only used with SqlStoreFactory.

# SQLStoreConnMaxLifetime

SetConnMaxLifetime sets the maximum duration of time that a database connection may be reused (see https://golang.org/pkg/database/sql/#DB.SetConnMaxLifetime).  Defaults to zero, which causes connections to be reused forever.  Only used with SqlStoreFactory.

If your database server has a config option to close inactive connections after some duration (e.g. MySQL "wait_timeout"), set SQLConnMaxLifetime to a value less than that duration.

Example Values:

	SQLConnMaxLifetime=14400s # 14400 seconds
	SQLConnMaxLifetime=2h45m  # 2 hours and 45 minutes
