Validation

The following settings are specific to message validation.

DataDictionary

XML definition file for validating incoming FIX messages. If no DataDictionary is supplied, only basic message validation will be done.

This setting should only be used with FIX transport versions older than FIXT.1.1. See TransportDataDictionary and AppDataDictionary for FIXT.1.1 settings. Value must be a valid XML data dictionary file. QuickFIX/Go comes with the following defaults in the spec directory

  FIX44.xml
  FIX43.xml
  FIX42.xml
  FIX41.xml
  FIX40.xml

TransportDataDictionary

XML definition file for validating admin (transport) messages. This setting is only valid for FIXT.1.1 (or newer) sessions.  See DataDictionary for older transport versions (FIX.4.0 - FIX.4.4) for additional information. Value must be a valid XML data dictionary file, QuickFIX/Go comes with the following defaults in the spec directory

 FIXT1.1.xml

AppDataDictionary

XML definition file for validating application messages. This setting is only valid for FIXT.1.1 (or newer) sessions. See DataDictionary for older transport versions (FIX.4.0 - FIX.4.4) for additional information.

This setting supports the possibility of a custom application data dictionary for each session. This setting would only be used with FIXT 1.1 and new transport protocols. This setting can be used as a prefix to specify multiple application dictionaries for the FIXT transport. For example:

 DefaultApplVerID=FIX.4.2
 # For default application version ID
 AppDataDictionary=FIX42.xml
 # For nondefault application version ID
 # Use BeginString suffix for app version
 AppDataDictionary.FIX.4.4=FIX44.xml

Value must be a valid XML data dictionary file. QuickFIX/Go comes with the following defaults in the spec directory

 FIX50SP2.xml
 FIX50SP1.xml
 FIX50.xml
 FIX44.xml
 FIX43.xml
 FIX42.xml
 FIX41.xml
 FIX40.xml

ValidateFieldsOutOfOrder

If set to N, fields that are out of order (i.e. body fields in the header, or header fields in the body) will not be rejected. Useful for connecting to systems which do not properly order fields. Valid Values:
 Y
 N

Defaults to Y.

HeartBtInt

Heartbeat interval in seconds. Only used for initiators.	Value must be positive integer.

SocketConnectPort

Socket port for connecting to a session. Only used for initiators. Must be positive integer

SocketConnectHost

Host to connect to. Only used for initiators. Value must be valid IP address in the format of x.x.x.x or a domain name

SocketAcceptPort

SQLDataSourceName

The driver-specific data source name of the database to use.  Only used with SqlStoreFactory.
